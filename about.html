        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I've had technological interests from a young age, though I wasn't able to do much with them until late middle school/early high 
            school when I picked up basic programming with Python. Since then, I've been trying my luck with Lua, as well as various C based
            languages with Unity. After extensive file management practice via video game modding, I've also been looking to try my hand at
            creating my own games, where, admittedly, programming may be my weakest front.

            Aside from technology, I also have a knack for writing stories, and am self-editing the first draft to my novel. In my spare
            time, I like to write short stories, though many of them don't end up past a couple of pages, and very few of them reach a
            stopping point before they cut off.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
            I've applied for a military scholarship to finance my way through college, and am hoping that I get picked up on that, entering
            the US Navy, but before I graduate college I'd like to publish my novel and finish at least one game by myself. I've already
            started planning one out and hope to start proper development in the near future. As for the novel, editing takes time, and may
            be the longest part about writing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Past Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            My first job was working with my father installing wood floors, and I've been doing it since I can remember. It's hard work, and
            is part of the reason I'm going to college, so I don't have to spend all day working outside in the Florida heat and humidity
            doing backbreaking labor. Aside from that, it also gave me some skill in various manual fields like flooring installation, as well
            as surface knowlege in auto repair, landscaping, roofing, HVAC, carpentry, and general home maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as programming goes, most of my experience comes from attempts at making games or bots, none of which ended up as a successful
            undertaking, but as time goes on, and as I move from attempt to attempt, I slowly get closer and closer to the ultimate goal, and
            may even be able to create a game before I graduate from high school. Perhaps it is time to take a step back and focus on a simpler
            project, something that may be not necessarily easier, but shorter, so that I can at least have one completed project under my belt
            before I go about with big ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being a first generation American, I also have standards and ideals inherited from my parents, both of which immigrated from Romania
            in 1996. Because of this, I tend to have an outside perspective from the conventional way of thinking, being that I not only know
            how difficult it is to become successful, but I also know that it is indeed possible to become successful, even if you do not speak
            English or know anybody in this country.
